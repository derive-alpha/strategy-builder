Important: This repository is still a work-in-progress. There is no documentation, lots of issues are still open and there are several manual processes.

## What is front-root?

It's an attempt to make front-end development a little less painful. Yes, it is another boilerplate "thing". But this one aims to judge less on what JavaScript framework you use, or what server you run your application on.

## Is it ready?

No.

## Can use it?

Yes, but you might have to figure out some stuff yourself. If you want to make use of the gulpfile.js config, then go ahead. If you find something to fix or improve, add an issue or a pull request.
